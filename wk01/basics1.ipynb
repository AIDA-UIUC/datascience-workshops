Everything nowadays involves computing, and learning about how to control machines (either on a lower level through manipulating bits or on a higher level through machine learning) is all the hype.

It’s small, very closely resembles the English language, and has hundreds of existing third-party libraries. Some of these libraries are scientific and numeric computing libraries which can be used to analyze large amounts of data!   \n",

    "4. function body: what the function should do\n",

    "### The `return` keyword <a name=\"return\"></a>\n",
