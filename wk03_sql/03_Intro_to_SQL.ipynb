For example, you have one table that contains weather data for each day of the year, while another table has the number of Uber rides that were requested that day. If we want to do some analysis on Uber ridership in relation to the weather, then we would need to \"join\" the two datasets via the date (find all rows where the specific date exists in both datasets and combine all the columns). This operation is called a \"join\", and there are many different types.\n",
